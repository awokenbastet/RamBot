Shiro is a multipurpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/).<br>

A design goal was to keep the experience with her non-intrusive.<br>
That means there are currently neither modules for moderation/administration nor plans to make them.<br>
However since Shiro supports modules you can extend her to infinity!
