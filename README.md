## SHIRO IS DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED

This repository will stay online for educational purposes only.<br>
Even though Shiro's performance was far from perfect her plugin-loader and annotations were quite sophisticated.<br>
Combined with Groovy's beautiful syntax this makes writing Java actually fun o.o

All future development will take place in shiro's successor ["Karen"](https://github.com/sn0w/karen).<br/>
Goodbye Java. It was a fun ride but i want my fucking ram back.

Shiro is a kinda efficient, multipurpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/).<br>

A design goal was to keep the experience with her non-intrusive.<br>
That means there are currently neither modules for moderation/administration nor plans to make them.<br>
However since Shiro supports modules you can extend her to infinity!
