## SHIRO IS DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED

All development will take place in her successor ["Karen"](https://github.com/sn0w/karen).<br/>
Karen will effectively be a port of Shiro to the Rust language.<br>
Goodbye Java. It was a fun ride but i want my fucking ram back.

All docs will stay online at http://meetkaren.xyz/legacy until Karen is mature enough to replace Shiro.
