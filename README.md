Shiro is a hihgly efficient, multipurpose [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/).<br>

A design goal was to keep the experience with her non-intrusive.<br>
That means there are currently neither modules for moderation/administration nor plans to make them.<br>
However since Shiro supports modules you can extend her to infinity!

### Can I suggest features/commands/...?
YES!<br>
Go to [/issues](https://github.com/sn0w/shiro/issues)

### Are you kidding? Java is everything but not efficient...
I am not.<br>
Even while Playing music shiro only consumes about 32mb RAM\* and a few percent CPU.<br>
That's less than one open tab in Google Chrome.<br>
I archieved this by dumping runtime audio conversions.<br>
Shiro utilizes FFMPEG/libav and opusenc to process your audio **before** sending it to discord.<br>

###### \*In-Use heap. Results may vary depending on JVM version and active Garbage Collector.
### Requirements
- Any OS and CPU that runs Java 8 [or Docker]
- About 32mb of free RAM
- About 20mb of free HDD space [The docker image needs additional 250mb]
- A MySQL server (anywhere. Maybe at bplaced? ðŸ˜…)
- FFMPEG/libav, youtube-dl and opusenc if you want to use the Music module
- Internet connection, duh

### Docker? Docker!
Just do a 
```
docker run -dv /docker/shiro:/data --link <mysql-container>:mysql sn0w/shiro:<full commit id or branch name>
```
and everything is ready! :)
